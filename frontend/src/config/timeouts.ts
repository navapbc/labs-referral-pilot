 * Timeout for streaming LLM responses (resources and action plans)

 *
 * Reasoning: Streaming operations involve long-running LLM inference that can take
 * several minutes, especially for complex queries or when generating comprehensive
 * resource lists. The 10-minute timeout provides sufficient buffer for:
 * - LLM inference time (varies by query complexity)
 * - Network latency and streaming overhead
 * - Backend processing (RAG retrieval, validation, etc.)

/**
 * Timeout for legacy non-streaming action plan generation
 * 120,000ms = 2 minutes
 *
 * Reasoning: The non-streaming action plan endpoint is a legacy fallback that
 * returns the complete response at once. This is faster than streaming but still
 * requires LLM inference time. The 2-minute timeout is sufficient because:
 * - Action plans are typically shorter than full resource lists
 * - Non-streaming has less overhead than SSE
 * - Used as a fallback when streaming is not available
 *
 * Note: This differs from STREAMING_TIMEOUT (10 min) for the streaming version.
 * Consider standardizing to STREAMING_TIMEOUT if this endpoint is still used.

 * - Sufficient buffer for network latency
 * - Quick failure for unavailable API (better UX than long wait)
 * - Allows the app to continue with degraded functionality if lookup fails

 * Timeout for email delivery operations

 * - Awaiting delivery confirmation
 * The 5-minute timeout balances user experience with reliability.

 * - Prevents indefinite loading state
 * - 12 seconds is long enough for initial API response but short enough to
 *   maintain good UX (users expect feedback within 10-15 seconds)
 * - Clears automatically once first resource arrives

 * - Not too long to clutter the UI
 * - Follows common UX patterns for undo notifications (5-10 seconds)
