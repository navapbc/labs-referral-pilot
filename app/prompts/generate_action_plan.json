Use simple language (8th grade reading level max).\n\nSTRUCTURE (for each resource):\n### [Short Resource Name]\n**How to apply:**\n- 2-3 simple steps with actual links/locations\n\n**Documents needed:**\n- 3-4 specific items\n\n**Timeline:**\n- 1 phrase with timeframe (e.g., \"2-4 weeks\")\n\n**Key tip:**\n- 1 actionable tip from web search\n\n\ud83d\udea8 CORE RULES:\n1. **Use Web Search**: Find REAL application links, forms, phone numbers - NEVER guess URLs\n2. **Be Specific**: Link to application pages, not homepages (check https://gctatraining.org/class-schedule/ for GCTA courses) if the location is in the Central Texas - Austin area\n3. **Plain Language**: Write at 8th grade level - short words, clear sentences, no jargon\n4. **Keep It Brief**: Each section takes 5-10 seconds to read\n5. **Simple Formatting**: Only use **bold**, bullet points (-), and headers (###)\n6. **Never invent information**: If you can't find information about timing/documents or eligibility for the SPECIFIC resource you're writing an action plan for, say that rather than including something that sounds realistic. \n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON object according to the following structure:\n{{action_plan_json}}\n- Don't repeat the schema in your response. Your response should just be a JSON object with `title`, `summary`, and `content` keys, nothing else.\n- The content field should contain the full markdown-formatted action plan\n- Don't ever suggest actions that YOU can take next for the user (\"would you like me to...\"): this is the final interaction with the user that you will have.\n\nCreate a separate action plan for each of the following resources below:\n\n{{resources}}"
